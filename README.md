# Sampling Based Active Information-acquisition

Simplified implementation of the "Sampling based active information acquisition" from the paper "Asymptotically Optimal Planning for Non-myopic Multi-Robot Information Gathering". The paper implements the algorithm with some simplifications. TODO: explain differences, environment, plot...

**DISCLAIMER:** THIS IMPLEMENTATION HAS NO RELATION WITH THE REAL AUTHORS AND THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES ON CORRECTNESS. Any correction, review or contribution would be really appreciated.
